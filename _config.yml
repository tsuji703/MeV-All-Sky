title: MeV gamma-ray all sky 
#description: This webpage describes a study of MeV gamma-ray all sky.
description: This page provides materials in the MeV gamma-ray sky, source catalog and all-sky maps. The source catalog is produced by a cross-matching of the hard X-ray (by Swift-BAT) and GeV gamma-ray (Fermi-LAT) catalogs. The all-sky maps made use of GALPROP for Galactic diffuse emission, the source catalog, and cosmic gamma-ray background (CGB) model by COMPTEL and SMM.
